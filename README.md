# W-State

### For 1:
Input: $$N = 2^k$$ qubits in the $$\ket{0 \dots 0}$$ state.

Goal: Change the state of the qubits to the W state - an equal superposition of $$N$$ basis states on $$N$$ qubits which have Hamming weight of 1.


### For 2:
Input: $$N$$ qubits in the $$\ket{0 \dots 0}$$ state. ($$N$$ is not necessarily a power of two).

Goal: Change the state of the qubits to the W state - an equal superposition of $$N$$ basis states on $$N$$ qubits which have Hamming weight of 1.
